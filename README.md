# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis model to analyze text data for emotional content. It includes two versions of the model:

1. **Sentiment Analysis without NLTK**: A straightforward implementation using basic Python libraries and custom logic.
2. **Sentiment Analysis with NLTK**: An enhanced version that utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for tokenization, stopword removal, and other natural language processing tasks.
